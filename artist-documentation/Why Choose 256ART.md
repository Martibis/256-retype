# Why Choose 256ART

### Fully In-Chain
Traditionally, in the world of generative art, the art script is (often) stored on-chain, but not offered through ERC721 standardized functions. The tokenURI which holds the traits, artwork, preview of the art etc. are usually hosted on a centralized server.

With 256ART both the metadata and live view of your art are entirely built and stored fully in-chain. This approach provides the best perseverance of your art as the artwork and the details related to it are permanently stored on the blockchain, ensuring they will always be accessible and immune to any potential data loss issues associated with centralized storage.

On front-ends and marketplaces, if a centralized URL, served through the tokenURI goes down, the NFT would no longer be accessible through standardized functions. This problem is non-existent with 256ART's fully in-chain approach.

### A Platform for Artists
256ART is an open platform, allowing any artist to release their work. We want to empower artists to freely create and share their work on the blockchain, with as few hurdles as possible.
### Cost Efficient On-Chain Storage
We utilize gzip compression on your art script before putting it on-chain, significantly reducing the size and the cost of storing it on-chain. On average it's three times cheaper to store on-chain compared to a none gzipped version.
### Fully Automated Testing
We offer fully automated, one-button-click, testing. Eliminating the hassle of deploying to an testnets and dealing with the associated complexities / nuisances. Behind the scenes we spin up a Sepolia node on our back-end and run all of the tests (deploying, minting, building your art, etc.) on that node, so it emulates near exactly how it would be on the mainnet.
### Multi Chain
We allow fully in-chain releases on Ethereum, Base and the Sepolia testnet.
### Low fees
10% on primary sales and 10% of the royalty percentage you choose on secondary sales.
### Two Seeding Mechanisms
Random seed generated at mint or collector selected seed at mint.
### Three Sales Mechanisms
Fair Dutch Auction, Fixed Price or Open Edition. 
### Ownership Over Your Smart Contracts
You are the sole owner of the contract.
