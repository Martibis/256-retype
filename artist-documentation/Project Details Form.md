# Project Details Form

### Project name*
The name of your project, it should be unique and descriptive.
### Short description for the project*
A short description of your project. This description is stored on-chain, so it is recommended to keep it brief to reduce costs. The maximum character limit for this field is 1500 characters.
### Reserve price*
The reserve price or minimum price for your project. In the case of open-edition and fixed-price sales mechanisms, the price is the same as the reserve price. For Dutch Auction, the reserve price is used in the `currentPrice()` function in the smart contract to calculate the current price of the project during the auction, ensuring that you donâ€™t have to worry about halftime or other complexities. The starting mint price is roughly 25 times higher than the reserve price and lowers every 7.5 minutes (divided by roughly 1.5x each time) over a one hour duration.
### Sales mechanism*
The sales mechanism for your project. There are three options: Fair Dutch Auction, Fixed Price, and Open Edition.
### Seeding mechanism*
The seeding mechanism for your project. There are two options: Random at Time of Mint and Collector Chooses Seed.
### Collection size*
The total number of NFTs in the collection. Only applicable when the sales mechanism is not Open Edition.
### Allow list addresses
The addresses you wish to add to your allow list. Allow-listed addresses will be able to mint before the public mint opens at the reserve price. There is a limit of one mint per wallet.
### Artwork.js*
The JavaScript code that generates the artwork. [Generative Art Template](/artist-documentation/generative-art-template)  for more info. 
### Traits.json*

### Project libraries*
The external libraries used in your project. Multiple libraries can be selected from the provided list, but we recommend using as few as possible (getting large libraries from chain can significantly slow down getting your art from chain).
