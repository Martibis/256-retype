This means that you can technically recreate the artwork from that script if you have the developer skills to do so. However, other elements, such as the metadata, live HTML, and static image, are usually linked to a centralized or IPFS URL.","With 256ART both the metadata and live view of your art are entirely built and stored fully in-chain. This approach provides the best perseverance of your art as the artwork and the details related to it are permanently stored on the blockchain, ensuring they will always be accessible and immune to any potential data loss issues associated with centralized storage.","On front-ends and marketplaces, if a centralized URL goes down, an NFT relying on this URL would no longer be visible. This problem is non-existent with 256ART's fully in-chain approach.","Multiple JavaScript libraries are also available on-chain (most notably p5js and threejs)."]},{"l":"A Platform for Artists","p":["256ART is an open platform, allowing any artist to release their work. We want to empower artists to freely create and share their work on the Ethereum blockchain, with as few hurdles as possible."]},{"l":"Cost Efficient On-Chain Storage","p":["We utilize gzip compression on your art script before putting it on-chain, significantly reducing the size and the cost of storing it on-chain. On average it's three times cheaper to store on-chain compared to a none gzipped version. When rendering your art from chain the DecompressionStream web API is used to gunzip your art script after which it's injected it into the HTML. This is currently supported by all modern browsers except for Firefox (and they have it on their roadmap)."]},{"l":"Fully Automated Testing","p":["We offer fully automated, one-button-click, testing. Eliminating the hassle of deploying to an Ethereum testnet and dealing with the associated complexities / nuisances. Behind the scenes we spin up an Ethereum node on our back-end and run all of the tests (deploying, minting, building your art, etc.) on that node, so it emulates near exactly how it would be on the Ethereum mainnet."]},{"l":"Low fees","p":["7.5% on primary sales and 7.5% of the royalty percentage you choose on secondary sales (e.g.: if you set your secondary royalty to 10%, 256ART would get 0.75%)."]},{"l":"Two Seeding Mechanisms","p":["Random seed generated at mint or collector selected seed at mint."]},{"l":"Three Sales Mechanisms","p":["Fair Dutch Auction, Fixed Price or Open Edition."]},{"l":"Ownership Over Your Smart Contracts","p":["Most of the contract is immutable and you are the owner of the contract. From the contract you can:","Artist Mint: mint tokens to yourself or friends for free (only when no dutch auction is in progress).","Withdraw Funds: withdraw your funds from the contract.","Withdraw from Royalty Splitter: withdraw your share of the royalties.","Update Image Base URL: update the image base URL for your project, allowing you to host the preview images of your art yourself or use alternatives like IPFS.","Update Maximum Token Supply: update the maximum number of tokens that can be minted for your project, mainly to cap the supply at a lower amount if a series doesn't mint out.","Update Art Scripts: update the art scripts associated with your project, mainly to improve preservation, allowing you to make changes to your art script as browser technology evolves.","Update Library Scripts: update the library scripts used in your projects, mainly to improve preservation, ensuring compatibility with any changes made to underlying libraries or browser technology."]}],[{"l":"Getting Started"},{"l":"Logging in and Creating an Artist Account","p":["To log in and create an artist account on 256ART, follow these steps:","Visit the 256ART website and navigate to the Artist Portal.","You will be prompted to sign a message with your Ethereum wallet.","Once logged in, you will be able to update your artist details and create new projects."]},{"i":"updating-artist-details-profile-picture-artist-name-bio-etc","l":"Updating Artist Details (Profile Picture, Artist Name, Bio, etc.)","p":["After logging in you can update various details about yourself as an artist.

Make sure the output is dimension agnostic, meaning it scales seamlessly to any dimension. Define a default dimension and create a multiplier to scale coordinates or sizes relative to the canvas dimensions.","Modify the traits.json file for the traits for your generative artwork. Keep in mind that traits.json is only for the traits you would like to store on the Ethereum blockchain. These traits cannot depend on the values of other traits.","Access the traits defined in traits.json from artwork.js/ artwork-p5.js using the inputData object. For example, if you defined a trait for color in traits.json, you could access this trait in your code like this:"]},{"l":"Available Libraries","p":["Only use libraries available on EthFS, as the libraries need to be available on chain. To use one of the available libraries during development, add a CDN to the library in the index.html file.
