The tokenURI which holds the traits, artwork, preview of the art etc. are usually hosted on a centralized server.","With 256ART both the metadata and live view of your art are entirely built and stored fully in-chain. This approach provides the best perseverance of your art as the artwork and the details related to it are permanently stored on the blockchain, ensuring they will always be accessible and immune to any potential data loss issues associated with centralized storage.","On front-ends and marketplaces, if a centralized URL, served through the tokenURI goes down, the NFT would no longer be accessible through standardized functions. This problem is non-existent with 256ART's fully in-chain approach."]},{"l":"A Platform for Artists","p":["256ART is an open platform, allowing any artist to release their work. We want to empower artists to freely create and share their work on the blockchain, with as few hurdles as possible."]},{"l":"Cost Efficient On-Chain Storage","p":["We utilize gzip compression on your art script before putting it on-chain, significantly reducing the size and the cost of storing it on-chain. On average it's three times cheaper to store on-chain compared to a none gzipped version."]},{"l":"Fully Automated Testing","p":["We offer fully automated, one-button-click, testing. Eliminating the hassle of deploying to an testnets and dealing with the associated complexities / nuisances.

With 256ART we simplify the development process compared to other platforms by requiring only one artwork.js file (for rendering your art) and a simple traits.json file for defining traits. Our template also emulates everything exactly the same ways as it would be if deployed live on the Ethereum or Base mainnet."]},{"l":"Random class","p":["We very strongly recommend using our Random class, which is an improved version of the Random class provided by ArtBlocks.

This template provides a starting point for creating generative art that can be released fully in-chain via 256ART. The main files you will be working with are:","artwork.js or artwork-p5.js: Contains the code for generating your generative art.","traits.json: Defines the traits that should be stored on-chain.","Follow the instructions in the readme.md file to get started."]},{"l":"Customizing the Template","p":["Modify the artwork.js/ artwork-p5.js file to implement your desired artwork. Make sure the output is dimension agnostic, meaning it scales seamlessly to any dimension. Define a default dimension and create a multiplier to scale coordinates or sizes relative to the canvas dimensions.","Modify the traits.json file for the traits for your generative artwork. Keep in mind that traits.json is only for the traits you would like to store on the blockchain. These traits cannot depend on the values of other traits.","Access the traits defined in traits.json from artwork.js/ artwork-p5.js using the inputData object. For example, if you defined a trait for \"Paint Color\" in traits.json, you could access this trait value in your code like this:"]},{"l":"Available Libraries","p":["Only use libraries available on EthFS, as the libraries need to be available on chain. To use one of the available libraries during development, add a CDN to the library in the index.html file. We recommend using as few libraries as possible (getting large libraries from chain can significantly slow down getting your art from chain). Some of the libraries available on EthFS at the time of writing are:","p5js v1.5.0","Tone.js (version unknown)","threejs v0.147.0"]},{"l":"Image Preview Generation for 256ART","p":["To allow 256ART to generate image previews of your generative artwork for marketplaces, digital galleries, and other front-ends, you need to set the window.rendered property equal to the canvas object when the work is fully rendered. This way, 256ART can capture the generated canvas, create an image preview, and store it as part of the tokenURI in the ERC721 smart contract under the \"image\" property.","Make sure to add the following line of code in your artwork.js/ artwork-p5.js file once the artwork is completely rendered:","For example, in a p5js sketch, you could add the window.rendered = c.canvas; line at the end of the draw() function after the artwork has been fully rendered:","By setting the window.rendered property, you are providing 256ART with a signal to capture the rendered canvas and generate an image preview. Providing image previews is needed for front-ends as they may not be able to render multiple \"live rendering\" of the art script, especially when the artworks are resource-intensive. The image previews make it easier for front-ends to display your generative art without the performance overhead of rendering the artwork live."]},{"l":"Batch Artwork Generator","p":["When your artwork-p5.js or artwork.js and your traits.json are completed, you can use the batch artwork generator for testing purposes. The Batch Artwork Generator tool streamlines the creation of multiple previews. It allows you to specify the number of previews and their dimensions, generates them efficiently, and provides an option to download all images as a ZIP file."]},{"l":"Features","p":["Batch Generation: Create multiple artworks in one go.","Customizable Image Size: Define the width and height for each image.","Progress Monitoring: Visual progress bar to track generation.","Download as ZIP: Easily download all generated images together."]},{"l":"How to Use","p":["Open the Generator:","Navigate to batch-generator.html in your browser. Ensure it's served from a local server.","Configure Parameters:","Batch Size: Enter the number of artworks you wish to generate.","Image Size: Specify the desired size in pixels.","Start Generation:","Click the Start Batch button. The progress bar will indicate the generation status.","Download Images:","Once completed, click the Download All as ZIP button to download all generated artworks."]},{"l":"Creating Dynamic Artworks","p":["With 256ART exposing a variety of blockchain parameters through the inputData object, you can create generative artworks that respond to on-chain events and states. This allows your artwork to evolve based on actions such as transfers, sales, or changes in an owner's ETH balance.
