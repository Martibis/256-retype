# The Gallery Page

### Overview of the Gallery Page

The Gallery Page is your personal space within 256ART, displaying all the artworks you've collected. It allows you to interact with your collection in various ways, including viewing your art live from chain, accessing high-resolution images, and re-rendering images if needed.

### Accessing Your Gallery Page

To access your Gallery Page, you'll need to sign in with your wallet. After successfully signing in, you'll be able to view and manage all the 256ART pieces you've collected.

### Live View

This feature allows you to see your artwork as it exists live on the Ethereum blockchain. To do this, click on a piece in your gallery to open the modal and select the "Live View" option. This will pull the artwork directly from the Ethereum chain. This ensures you are seeing the most accurate and up-to-date representation of your artwork, as it's pulled directly from the chain.


### High Resolution Image

Your Gallery Page allows you to view and download high-resolution image previews of your collected artworks. To do this, click on a piece in your gallery to open the modal and select the "High Res Image" option.

### Triggering a Re-render of Your Artworks

In case there are issues with the rendering of your high resolution image, you can trigger a re-render from your Gallery Page. To do this, click on the piece you want to rerender for, and in the modal and select the 'Rerender' option. Please keep in mind it can take up to fifteen minutes for you request to be processed.
